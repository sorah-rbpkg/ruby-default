ruby-defaults (1:2.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  This new version introduces two important changes:

  - Ruby 2.0 is now the default Ruby version, so installing `ruby` will
    actually give you `ruby2.0`
  - Ruby 1.8 is not supported anymore and will be dropped soon. Therefore this
    package now conflicts with `ruby1.8`.
